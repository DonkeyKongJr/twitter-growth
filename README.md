# twitter-growth

With twitter-growth you can automatically add followers of a target account to your friends list. For this purpose you have to set a targetAccountName.

`const targetAccountName = 'ORF';`

Keep in mind that you only allowed to follow 1.000 accounts a day and somewhere around 5.000 totals, with some exceptions give.
In the config.json you set your twitter app tokens so that you can consume the api.
